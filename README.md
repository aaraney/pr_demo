# Pull Request Demo

This repo shows the process of opening and committing some code via a pull request.

Process overview:
1. Fork the repo / open a branch
2. Complete work on the branch that hopefully links back to an issue
3. Push work as usual to your fork or branch
4. Open a pull request and compare if the work is mergable
  1. Depending on the size of the work, add reviewers and start a conversation
  2. If the work is small, add relavent information on what was done to the PR comment
5. If applicable, have someone else merge the PR into master, else merge it yourself
